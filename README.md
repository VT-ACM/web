## About

Source for the ACM@VT website. Written with [docpad](http://docpad.org/). Big thanks to [Robert Senkbeil](https://github.com/rcsenkbeil/acm) for all the work he put into creating the original.

Check out the (in progress) docpad tutorials on [Youtube](not-actually-a-real-link.com)! Once you've done that, fork this repo and make your own contributions!

## Contributing

Here's how to get up and running to make changes to the site locally:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install [git](git-scm.com)
3. Now run the following

```bash     
npm install -g docpad
git clone https://github.com/VT-ACM/web.git && cd web
npm install
```

If that worked, you should be ready to run the website locally:
     
     docpad run

If that didn't work, open an issue in this repo with details on your error.
