This coming Friday, November 13th, Jon Shiring (a lead programmer at Respawn Entertainment and VT alum) will be giving a talk on networking in online FPS games. The talk will be held at 6:00PM in McBryde 210 and will last roughly an hour with time at the end for questions.

**About the talk:**

Jon will dive deep and take you from basics like UDP networking, different game architectures, and into a basic model for most online FPS games.  He will cover how to network thousands of entities, world interpolation with network updates, local user prediction and how to correct for prediction errors.  We'll discuss "Anti-Lag" technology, predicting damage to other players, and then diving deep into how Valve games work and how Titanfall differs.  This is an extremely thorough discussion that will give you some expertise is an area that isn't well understood even inside the game industry.  You do not need to have any networking experience to get something from this talk.

**About Jon:**

After graduating from Virginia Tech in 2000, Jon started working in games in 2001. Fairly in-over-his-head, he managed to ship a multiplayer-only game called Savage: The Battle for Newerth in 2003 at S2 Games, and then joined Infinity Ward in 2004. At Infinity Ward he worked almost exclusively on multiplayer and shipped Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and Modern Warfare 2. In 2010, Jon and large group of Infinity Ward employees started Respawn Entertainment, where he is now a Lead Programmer. He shipped Titanfall in 2014 on Xbox One and PC, which used a massive amount of Azure cloud-based servers to host the game servers. He is eager to talk about Titanfallâ€™s online tech and ready to answer your meanest questions as best as he can.

Jon is also giving a talk about online game servers and system design on Thursday evening at Rackspace. More info here: [racksburg.com/multiplayer-games-in-the-cloud/](http://racksburg.com/multiplayer-games-in-the-cloud/)
