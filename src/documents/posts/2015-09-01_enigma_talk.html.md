How Alan Turing Broke an Impossible Nazi Cipher
===============================================

During WWII the British were perplexed by a new Nazi encryption machine:
Enigma. The outcome of the entire war was dependent on cracking the secret
code and revealing German operations. In this unique session you will learn
exactly how Alan Turing, genius mathematician, inventor of computer science,
and subject of the movie "The Imitation Game", broke the Enigma cipher by
inventing an amazing electro-mechanical machine: The Bombe. Come learn how
Alan found critical flaws in the Enigma machine, developed a method to
exploit those flaws, and built a machine that helped win the war for the
allies. Included is a demo of an on-line Enigma machine, and a full run of a
Bombe simulator!
