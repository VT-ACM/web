There is a yearly online developers' conference called `hack.summit()`. They
have great talks by smart people, and it's free. Last year, probably this year
too, if you missed the livestream, they posted the videos to youtube after, so
there's no excuse not to catch some of the talks. Uncle Bob will be presenting,
among other big deals.

February 22nd-24th, 2016
