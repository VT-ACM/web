Becoming a member of the Virginia Tech Chapter of the ACM does not require that 
you are a CS Major or that you know much at all about technology. We welcome 
anyone who as an interest in learning and sharing knowledge. Becoming a member 
gets you the following:

* Voting Rights
* A chance to know the CS faculty
* Ability to attend members only social events
* A more closed setting with potential employers and companies

To become a member, you pay $20 for the entire year which goes towards our 
local chapter Social Events and Tech Talks. This can be paid in person to any 
of our officers.
