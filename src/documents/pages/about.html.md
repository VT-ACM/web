The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is widely recognized as a 
premier organization for computing professionals and students. Since 
1947, the national chapter has provided resources and backed research and 
policies that benefit the academic community. The ACM chapter at Virginia 
Tech has devoted itself to following this tradition. Our goal is to unite 
the students and faculty of Virginia Tech who may be interested in computing 
and provide for them a forum for intellectual discussion.

Here at Virginia Tech, the ACM has made a commitment to serving our members 
by facilitating their growth and knowledge through a variety of means. We seek 
to bring both industry and academia closer to our members and our members 
closer to them by providing venues for the sharing and transfer of knowledge. 
We also hope to provide a number of networking opportunities that will last 
past our members' involvement with the chapter. Furthermore, we aim to provide 
a number of opportunities for our members to be involved in which uphold our 
college motto Ut Prosim ("That I May Serve").

others.
